    "# PLAY INFORMATION\n",
    "- <b>Play Information</b>: Play level data that describes the type of play, possession team, score and a brief narrative of each play. Plays are uniquely identified using a its PlayID along with the corresponding GameKey. <b>PlayIDs ARE NOT UNIQUE.</b>\n",
    "- All plays are punts (just check counts of 'Play_Type')\n",
    "- This dataset has alot of information that can be useful in your analysis. 'PlayDescription' tells you the summary of the play which can be used to parse and classify each play. You know where the ball is being punted from ('YardLine') and who is punting ('Poss_Team') so you can combine this information with 'PlayDescription' to synthesize how far a player returns the ball as well as create your own 'reward' metrics for placing a value on the punt return. <b>If you're going to implement a rule change that effects how the ball is received, you should understand what plays in this dataset, you'll have affected (usually negated).</b>\n",
    "    - I'm sure many folk are considering the CFL rule for a \"no yards penalty\" or some variation of it. Essentially the punt receiver (PR) gets at least a 5 yard buffer against any opponent player to allow for receiving the punt. Penalties are doled out if a punt team player that is not the punter or was behind the punter upon the punt enters this restricted area. Note CFL does not have a fair catch rule. Anyway a rule where there is some restricted area/safety area for the PR would result in many plays in this play dataset being negated. It's important to understand whats being negated and understand what value to the game if any is being lost as a result.\n",

If a punt team player infringes on this zone when the ball contacts a surface (player, field, ref) after the ball has been punted, the play is called dead and a 10 yard penalty is assesed from where the ball contacts a surface after the ball has been punted. A PR must be making attempt to catch the ball for this restricted zone to apply."
